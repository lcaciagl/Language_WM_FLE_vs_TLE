# Language and Working Memory in FLE and TLE

This repository has been created to store code devised for multi-scale functional mapping of cognitive fMRI data in people with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and healthy controls. Specifically, here we provide code in relation to scale 2 and scale 3 of our analysis, namely:

- Quantification of task-related effects across seven canonical functional systems (described in Yeo, Krienen al., J. Neurophysiol 2011)
- Profiling of task-effects along the principal gradient of intrinsic functional connectivity (described in Margulies et al., P.N.A.S. 2016)

There is one example code, looking at verbal working memory data, for both systems-based (FLE_TLE_analysis_code_Yeo_vol_2019_2021_LC_NB.m) and gradient-based (FLE_TLE_analysis_code_Gradient_2019_2021_LC_NB.m) stratification of task effects. An additional display function (FLE_TLE_analysis_code_DisplayGradientData_CTR_NB.m) accompanies gradient code.

The above code will require some helper functions (e.g. Surfstat add-ons, function to create and edit radar plots, etc.) that are all available at the MICA lab github page (https://github.com/MICA-MNI/micaopen). Appropriate indications are provided in each code file.
