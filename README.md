# Language_WM_FLE_vs_TLE

This repository has been created to store code devised to carry out a multi-scale assessment of cognitive task fMRI data in people with frontal lobe epilepsy, temporal lobe epilepsy and healthy controls, employing:
1) Voxel-based analyses (SPM, SnPM)
2) Quantification of task-related effects across seven canonical functional systems (described in Yeo, Krienen al., J. Neurophysiol 2011)
3) Profiling of task-effects along the principal gradient of intrinsic functional connectivity (described in Margulies et al., P.N.A.S. 2016)

Code will be openly available upon publication of the related manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal.
