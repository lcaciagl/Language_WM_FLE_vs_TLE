# Language_WM_FLE_vs_TLE

This repository has been created to store code devised for multi-scale functional mapping of cognitive fMRI data in people with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and healthy controls. Specifically, here we provide code in relation to scale 2 and scale 3 of our analysis, namely:
- Quantification of task-related effects across seven canonical functional systems (described in Yeo, Krienen al., J. Neurophysiol 2011)
- Profiling of task-effects along the principal gradient of intrinsic functional connectivity (described in Margulies et al., P.N.A.S. 2016)
