# Language_WM_FLE_vs_TLE

This repository contains code devised to carry out a multi-scale assessment of task-based fMRI data in people with frontal lobe epilepsy, temporal lobe epilepsy and healthy controls, which includes:
1) Voxel-based analyses (SPM, SnPM)
2) Quantification of task-related effects across seven canonical functional systems (Yeo et al., J Neurophysiol 2011)
3) Profiling of task-effects along the principal gradient of intrinsic functional connectivity (Margulies et al., 2016)

Code will be made openly available upon publication of the related manuscript
